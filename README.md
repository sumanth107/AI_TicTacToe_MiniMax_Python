Requirements: Install pygame module (if you haven't already) and any environment to run python codes (goes without saying, I know)  
I've written a code with which you get to play Tic Tac Toe with an AI which uses MiniMax algorithm. This algorithm helps the AI to decide the optimum move at each step and thereby making it practically unbeatable!!
